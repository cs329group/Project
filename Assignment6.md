# Communication Plan
In this homework, I assume that your final project is part of a senior design context. 

## Stakeholders
1. The client who wants to build the online booking system
2. The sponsor of your project who provides the initial seed money
3. The faculty member who provides technical advices
4. Three industrial review board members who will listen to your final presentation
5. Team members
6. The managers of hotels who volunteer to test your system when it is ready
7. A few testers from a bank who will test the financial transactions between your system and their bank 
8. Faculty members who will participate into your final presentation as the audience (no grading).
