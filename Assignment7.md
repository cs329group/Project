# Risk Analysis
 
In this homework, you are required to investigate the following top-10 risks in software projects:

###1. Personnel shortfalls
This risk can be caused by workers not having the skill for web development. We can minimize this risk by training each other to learn the environment and web design.
###2. Unrealistic schedules and budgets
A schedule could be planned out, but impossible to complete the tasks in time, or we gave ourselves too much time to do the tasks which could also run us low on our budget (If we were paid…). To avoid this risk, determining what needs to be done as early as possible is crucial. Then with that information, you can create ‘Function Point Counting’ to get estimated times for tasks, and also use PDM diagrams to plan out the tasks.
###3. Developing the wrong software functions

###4. Developing the wrong user interface
As we rework the different pages of Expedia, the UI could become unusable or confusing to the user. It is important analyse the tasks the user needs to do to better create the UI. We also will create a prototype to get quick feedback as we work on the final version.
###5. Gold plating
These are extra features or ‘fluff’. This can include adding fancy animations to the UI. These extra features would be nice, but they aren’t necessary. To figure out which features we can keep and which ones we have to scrap, we can look at our scheduling, or do a cost-benefit analysis on the project to determine the optimal path to take for our time and features.
###6. Continuing stream of requirements changes
If requirements such as how a user searches for a plane changes, it can lead to us having to remake whole pages to fit the requirement again, costing more time and money. To minimize the impact, we could use an incremental development process. So if requirements do changes, they may not have even been implemented yet, or we just defer the changes to later increments.
###7. Shortfalls in externally performed tasks

###8. Shortfalls in externally furnished components
TODO
###9. Real-time performance shortfalls
We want flight bookings to be near instant, even at high loads. We will fall short if a user tries to book a flight, but the page sits there loading, causing to wonder if the request went through. To minimize this risk, it is important for use to simulate high loads on the server and test out different actions and requests on the website. This would allow us to see which functions of the site is struggling to meet our prefered speeds.
###10. Straining computer science capabilities
TODO

For each of the risk, please provide a short explanation to analyze how it would apply to your final project. What would you do to mitigate or minimize those risks?
